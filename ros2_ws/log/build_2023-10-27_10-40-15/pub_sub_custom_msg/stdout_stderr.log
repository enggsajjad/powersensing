[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmap_messages.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "map_messages", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "map_messages" with
  any of the following names:

    map_messagesConfig.cmake
    map_messages-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "map_messages" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "map_messages_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "map_messages" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
