[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcustom_msg1.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "custom_msg1", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "custom_msg1" with
  any of the following names:

    custom_msg1Config.cmake
    custom_msg1-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "custom_msg1" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "custom_msg1_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "custom_msg1" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
